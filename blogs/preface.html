            This is my first blog post.<br><br>
            This blog is to be considered as a manifestation of my thoughts, opinions and outlooks on whatever
            I will be talking about here, and many other posts to come. Surely, these might change as time
            goes by, for every one of us is human, and opinions and outlooks will inevitably change or modify once
            an inflow of information, that contradicts or affirms your current beliefs, is present. What this cannot 
            be considered is as something that is to be followed blindly. I do not intend to set this as instructions
            to the ones who are reading this as of the current moment.
            <br><br>

            If you agree with me, good.<br>
            If you don't, feel free to initiate a conversation with me.
            <br><br>

            I come from a diverse background, and you probably won't see me writing about I'm from or where I'm based, but one thing
            I'm sure of is that I intend to be someone of value. Someone that provides you, the reader, value for reading this. If you
            understand where I am coming from, all of my other posts will definitely be easier to grasp and get an understanding about.
            <br><br>

            One thing I should mention is that, my blogs will range in a bunch of topics, and not confined to one niche or topic only;
            I'm constantly fascinated by all the things I learn about everyday, and this is a portal through which I would like to share
            this to myself and to you, for I find current social media very distracting, very diluted from the quality of thought, and
            currently designed to insinuate the most amount of people for the most amount of profit, even if it's philosophy wasn't
            to be like this. I will be talking about this in a future blog post for sure, but this primarily is to avoid the social algorithm.
            <br><br>

            Before you mention, "hey he just blatantly copied write.as!!!" yes i absolutely did. so what?
            I'm a pretty privacy-paranoid individual, so I avoid making more accounts on the Internet than needed.
            I was absolutely inspired from the clean, sleek design language that the guys at <a href="https://write.as">write.as</a> have, and I
            just couldn't resist. So decided to recreate the whole UI from scratch since their source code is proprietary.
            So this is, getting inspired and creating your own version since you liked it so much that you couldn't
            but follow them completely. Thank you to <a href="https://write.as">write.as</a>, I owe you a ton for 
            impressing me with your visuals, and teaching me a little bit of programming. 
            <br><br>

            Complete control: something both me and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" target="_blank">Steve Jobs</a> have in common. 
            This blog is a social proof of that exact trait. While I definitely cannot control every single thing
            or person around me, I certainly like to tweak everything to my liking. (i don't use arch, btw)
            <br><br>

            I do not know what happens in the future, I try not to indulge myself about the past, but I can sense that I might find some of the parts
            of this post particularly cringe or embarassing in the near future. If that is the case, then I have grown, which is a good thing. Let this be
            part of my current identity, or past identity in the near future.
            <br><br>

            I also have realised while writing this, the tone and energy of this post seems particularly heavy, I do not know why. It feels more like a T&Cs
            section of a product than a book's preface which it was originally intended to be. I could have taken the easy way out and created a post in just
            any other cloud-based blogsite, but I decided to take the hard way #nopainnogain (for legal reasons, that's sarcasm)
            <br><br>

            I'm learning JavaScript as I speak, and this is one way I can put that into use, but I haven't used a single line of JS as I write this.
            Still learning, but let's see how long till my get my own domain to showcase my React/Svelte skills over here. The end goal is to create
            my own website, with my own domain, and port all this over there once it's done, and this will stay as a remnant of what I was and what I
            am right now, and also providing the viewer a chance to see where I have reached in my journey.
            <br><br>

            Have you ever heard about the Dead Internet Theory? If you have, thanks for not living in a cave lmao. Many people still don't know about this
            and it's safe to say that none of my content, now and later, is or will be created by a bot or an AI, and that I merely see these two things as a tool and
            nothing more. I despise the use of AI for creative work, especially something that people will consume, and I am already fed up with the amount
            of content that I see on the Internet being generated by AI, not to mention, the amount of fake engagement and repetitive content that is online
            just sickens me and makes me constantly doubt whether whatever I actively consume on the Internet is even real or not. It's not far for us to reach a point
            in the modern world, where we will stop recognizing what is fake and what is not, because these systems are improving as we speak while our senses of recognition
            are being constantly bombarded with such content and making our psyche numb to the abnormality, for which we further refuse to recognise something that is very
            evidently artifiical. While I understand that this is, at the end of the day, just a tool, this has unprecedented effects when abused by the general populace like this.
            <br><br>

            I do not create or wish to contribute to the amount of internet trash there is with artificially generated content of the likes; whatever you see here
            is produced, created and written completely by me, without the interference of a machine. I'm someone who believes that there should be
            more human-generated content around here, because creativity cannot be replaced. More precisely, human creativity cannot cease to exist for it is
            something more semantic (pardon my english, i should use smth else here) and not logical as is dealt by the modern AGI that we have at our disposal. As AGI technology advances, what I believe we
            should do, is resist by making our own content, something that we have complete control over. I despise the Dead Internet Theory coming to a reality 
            in front of our own eyes. Some might argue that we will be further feeding AI with our content if we do so, thus making them only better. While that
            argument is wholly correct, and that AI systems are being trained on whatever is publicly available on the internet, we MUST have human-generated
            content over here. How long before all you see is AI-slop? More on this in a future post.
            <br><br>
            
            Geopolitics, languages and technology are some of the things I will be talking about in general.
            I have my interests in creating videos too, and I hope to start soon as well, since I am working 
            on one video project as I speak. I have never blogged, neither vlogged before, and these are some
            first times. I am getting a gist of whatever I'm doing here and I plan to continue some of my
            creative work even in my later years. As I'm sure you might have noticed in this article, I have
            been switching up to a lot of topics, and that is precisely something I will try to avoid in my
            future posts, for this unnecessarily lengthens the topic of our discussion and it possibly might
            ruin the experience of reading for some people, not mentioning that it might just distract us from 
            whatever we have in hand. Let's not ADHD our way into this.
            <br><br>

            To conclude,<br>
            Whatever you see in current and future posts, is completely created by me.<br>
            You are at your own discretion of how you are affected and how you decide to act reading my work.<br>
            This is not a Bible, and definitely not something you shouldn't take with a grain of salt.<br>
            If you're offended by my words, do not forget that to each there is a freedom of speech.<br>
            Feel free to reach out whenever you feel like you might have a point. I will try to reply most, if not all.<br>
