            This is my first blog post.<br><br>
            This blog is to be considered as a manifestation of my thoughts, opinions and outlooks
            on whatever I will be talking about here, and many other posts to come. Surely, for everyone
            of us is human, my opinions, outlooks and philosophies might change or modify once an inflow
            of information, that contradicts or affirms my current beliefs, is present. What this cannot
            be considered is as something that is to be followed blindly, this is not a Bible, so isn't
            99% of the things that you are exposed to on the Internet. I do not intend to set this as 
            instructions to the ones who are reading this as of the current moment.
            <br><br>

            If you agree with me, good.<br>
            If you don't, feel free to initiate a conversation with me.
            <br><br>

            I come from a diverse background, and you probably won't see me writing about I'm from
            or where I'm based, but one thing I'm sure of is that I intend to be someone of value.
            Someone that provides you, the reader, value for reading this. If you understand where
            I am coming from, all of my other posts will definitely be easier to grasp and get an 
            understanding about. Mind you, that you are at your own discretion of how you are affected 
            and how you decide to act reading my work. You are in control of yourself, not me. If you're
            offended by my words, do not forget that to each we have a right to speak up and what we have 
            in mind. This isn't Nazi Germany, is it?
            <br><br>

            My blogs will range in a bunch of topics, not confined to one niche; I'm constantly fascinated 
            by all the things I learn about everyday, and this is a portal through which I would like to 
            share this to myself and to you, for I find current social media very distracting, very diluted
            from the quality of thought, and currently designed to insinuate the most amount of people for 
            the most amount of profit, even if it's philosophy wasn't to be like this. I will be talking 
            about this in a future blog post for sure, but this primarily is to avoid the social algorithm.
            You should let no algorithm control you, your thoughts nor your words.

            I'm a pretty privacy-paranoid individual, so I avoid making more accounts on the Internet 
            than needed. Thank you to <a href="https://write.as">write.as</a>, I owe you a ton for impressing
            me with your visuals, and teaching me a little bit of programming as a result. Your clean, sleek 
            design language has enthralled me, and I just couldn't resist. I decided to recreate the whole UI
            from scratch since your source code is proprietary, and I tweaked it slightly according to my taste, 
            still keeping the similar feel to it. 
            <br><br> 

            I can sense that I might find some of the parts of this post particularly cringe or embarassing
            in the near future. If that is the case, then I have grown, which is a good thing.
            <br><br>

            I also have realised while writing this, the tone and energy of this post seems particularly 
            heavy. It feels more like a T&Cs section of a product than a book's preface which it was 
            originally intended to be. I could have taken the easy way out and created a post in just any 
            other cloud-based blogsite, but I decided to take the harder, more DIY way, while preserving 
            my privacy to a higher degree.

            I'm learning JavaScript as I speak, and this is one way I can put that into use, but I 
            haven't used a single line of JS as I write this. Still learning, but let's see how long
            till my get my own domain to showcase my React/Svelte skills over here. The end goal is 
            to create my own website, with my own domain, and port all this over there once it's done,
            and this will stay as a remnant of what I was as a person, providing the viewer a chance 
            to see where I have reached in my journey.

            Have you ever heard about the Dead Internet Theory? If you have, thanks for not living in 
            a cave lmao. None of my content, now and later, is or will be created by a bot or an AI. 
            I merely see these as tools, nothing more. I despise the use of AI for creative work, 
            especially something that people will consume, and I am already fed up with the amount of 
            content that I see on the Internet being generated by AI. The amount of fake engagement 
            and repetitive content just sickens me and makes me constantly doubt whether whatever I 
            actively consume on the Internet is even real or not. It's not far for us to reach a 
            point in the modern world, where we will stop recognizing what is real, because these 
            systems are improving continuously while our senses of recognition are being constantly 
            bombarded with such content and making our psyche numb to the abnormality, for which we 
            further refuse to recognize something that is very evidently artificial. This has 
            unprecedented effects when abused by the general populace like this.
            <br><br>

            
            I do not wish to contribute to the amount of internet trash present with artificially 
            generated content; whatever you see here is produced, created and written completely 
            by me, without the interference of a machine. I'm someone who believes that there should 
            be more human-generated content around, because creativity cannot be replaced. More 
            precisely, human creativity cannot cease to exist for it is something deeper and not 
            in the realms of the modern AGI that we have at our disposal. As AGI advances, what I
            believe we should do, is resist by making our own content, something that we have 
            complete control over. Some might argue that we will be further feeding AI with our 
            content if we do so, thus making them only better. While that argument is wholly correct, 
            and that AI systems are being trained on whatever is publicly available on the internet, 
            we MUST have human-generated content over here. How long before all you see is AI-slop? 
            More on this in a future post.
            <br><br>
            
            As I'm sure you might have noticed, I have been switching up to a lot of topics, and that 
            is precisely something I will try to avoid in my future posts, for this unnecessarily 
            lengthens our discussion and plausibly ruins the experience of reading, ignoring that it 
            distracts us from whatever we have at hand.

            Feel free to reach out whenever you feel like you might have a point.<br>
            I will try to reply most, if not all.
