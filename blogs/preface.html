            This is my first blog post.
            This blog should be considered as a manifestation of my thoughts, opinions and outlooks on whatever else
            I will be talking about on this, and many other posts to come. Of course, these might change as time
            goes by, for every one of us is human, and opinions and outlooks will inevitably change or modify once
            an inflow of information, that contradicts or affirms your current beliefs, is present.

            What this cannot be considered as something that is to be followed blindly. I do not intend to set this
            as instructions to the ones who are reading this as of the current moment. If you agree with me, good.
            If you don't, feel free to initiate a conversation with me.

            Before you mention, "hey he just blatantly copied write.as!!!" yes i absolutely did. so what?
            I'm a pretty privacy-paranoid individual, so I avoid making more accounts on the Internet than needed.
            I was absolutely inspired from the clean, sleek design language that the guys at <a href="https://write.as">write.as</a> have, and I
            just couldn't resist. So decided to recreate the whole UI from scratch since their source code is proprietary.
            So this is, getting inspired and creating your own version since you liked it so much that you couldn't
            but follow them completely. Thank you to <a href="https://write.as">write.as</a>, I owe you a ton for impressing me with your visuals, and teaching me a little bit of programming.

            I come from a diverse background, and you probably won't see me writing about I'm from or where I'm based, but one thing
            I'm sure of is that I intend to be someone of value. Someone that provides you, the reader, value for reading this. If you
            understand where I am coming from, all of my other posts will definitely be easier to grasp and get an understanding about.

            One thing I should mention is that, my blogs will range in a bunch of topics, and not confined to one niche or topic only;
            I'm constantly fascinated by all the things I learn about everyday, and this is a portal through which I would like to share
            this to myself and to you, for I find current social media very distracting, very diluted from the quality of thought, and
            currently designed to insinuate the most amount of people for the most amount of profit, even if it's philosophy wasn't
            to be like this. I will be talking about this in a future blog post for sure, but this primarily is to avoid the social algorithm.

            Complete control: something both me and <a href="https:/wikipedia.org/"><Steve Jobs</a> have in common. This blog is a social proof
            of that exact trait. While I definitely cannot control every single thing or person around me, I certainly like to tweak everything to
            my liking. (i don't use arch, btw)

            I do not know what happens in the future, I try not to indulge myself about the past, but I can sense that I might find some of the parts
            of this post particularly cringe or embarassing in the near future. If that is the case, then I have grown, which is a good thing. Let this be
            part of my current identity, or past identity in the near future.

            I also have realised while writing this, the tone and energy of this post seems particularly heavy, I do not know why. It feels more like a T&Cs
            section of a product than a book's preface which it was originally intended to be. I could have taken the easy way out and created a post in just
            any other cloud-based blogsite, but I decided to take the hard way #nopainnogain (for legal reasons, that's sarcasm)

            I'm learning JavaScript as I speak, and this is one way I can put that into use, but I haven't used a single line of JS as I write this.
            Still learning, but let's see how long till my get my own domain to showcase my React/Svelte skills.
